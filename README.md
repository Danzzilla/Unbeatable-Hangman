# Unbeatable Hangman
(March 2021)
Class HangmanMain is the driver program for the Hangman program.  It reads a
dictionary of words to be used during the game and then plays a game with
the user.  This is a cheating version of hangman that delays picking a word
to keep its options open. Class HangmanManager was created by me for the HangmanMain
to use. HangmanMain initiates the actions and HangmanManager defines the processes
that HangmanMain is to initiate.
